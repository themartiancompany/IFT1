and its source code published on the

as well as the [video file](
evmfs://100/0x69470b18f8b8b5f92b48f6199dcb147b4be96571/0x87003Bd6C074C713783df04f36517451fF34CBEf/60a20cec53f12ab33e78d542ed501756f29abc5e52bd9992062fea62197d61ce)

Only three non-fungible tokens exist
for this work, one for Jessica Kirsh,
one for me and
one for Elon Musk, when he will start showing
some compassion and publicly pay some
respect for hard work.

I love you Jess.
